The goals with the this code is a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game.




STARTER DEMANDS:
    - 3 x 3 grid
    - MAINLY an actual functional game haha



    - It is going to be terminal-based because it's more convienient for me as a newbie coder.
    - Two players sitting in front of the computer.
    - Anti-cheat (can't place if already a token there)
    - Check if someone wins
    - Some user friendliness
